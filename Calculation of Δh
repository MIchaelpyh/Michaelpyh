# This is a demonstration to solve Δh with a = 55 μm. Parameters in line 5 is calculated based on the materials properties and surface geometries. All parameters in line 5 should also be changed accrodingly if
different materials or geometry is adopted. For each surface geometry, a specific set of parameters for line 5 is required#
